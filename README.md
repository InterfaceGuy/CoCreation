# CoCreation

Co-creation refers to a synergistic and distributed creative act involving multiple entities who channel and express a divine idea collectively, resulting in an outcome greater than the sum of individual contributions. Unlike mere production, creation involves a mystical, trans-rational process where the divine is made manifested in material form. In a broader sense, humanity can be seen as co-creators with the divine, as every creative act reflects a collaboration with a higher source. Co-creation is thus an essential aspect of collective intelligence, highlighting the profound potential of collaborative creativity.
